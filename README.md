As the Director of Developer Relations at Mindee, I helps developers merge the physical and digital worlds using the magic of machine learning coupled with the ease of APIs. I had shared my passion for technology on the stage at dozens of events around the world. I helped build successful communities at npm, Mozilla, Microsoft, DigitalOcean, and Fitbit, and am the author of the book Personal Branding for Developers at Apress. Behind this extrovert that I am, is a very passionate individual who believes in the power of communication... and cat videos.
